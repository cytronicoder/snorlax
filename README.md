# Snorlax OS

I picked up [Thomas' OS building jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS) and decided to build a simple home screen for my browser. I named it after my favorite PokÃ©mon, and I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it because I had 3 days to build it. Why? Very good question. I don't know.

Let's just say that February 14th was also surrendipitously 3 days away.

## Features

Not much, but it has a clock, nice layouts, and a search bar that can search Google. It also has a nice background image of Snorlax (and Ditto?) courtesy of Giphy/Tenor. It also has two of my Spotify playlists embedded in it.

## How to use

Visit [snorlax.cytronicoder.com](https://snorlax.cytronicoder.com) to use it. You can also clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
